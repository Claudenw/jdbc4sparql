Complete functionality has not been tested.  However, most code is functional and testing should 
be completed in the near future.

# JDBC 4 SPARQL

JDBC 4 SPARQL is a JDBC Driver that uses a SPARQL endpoint (or Jena Model) as the data store.

JDBC 4 SPARQL is licensed under Apache License V2.  However, there is one component that is Licnsed under the GNU LGPL V3.0
this means that if you want to use this product in an environment that is not permitted under GNU LGPL V3.0 you will need to 
find another implementation of the SparqlParser interface.  How to do this is covered in the Extensions Points section of this 
document.

## Usage

### URL
The URL for the J4SDriver is 
    jdbc:j4s:[?catalog=<catalog>[&builder=<builder>]]:<sparqlendpoint url>

Currently the catalog must be supplied and only the default builder is supported.

Currently the catalog is built at runtime by the builder, however future improvements should include a mechanism to store an entire configuration of multiple catalogs.

the Catalog contains the URL for the SPARQL endpoint so it will be possible to configure the driver to access multiple endpoints.

## A Conflict Of Nomenclatures

SQL and SPARQL use nomenclatures that conflict with each other.  For the purposes of this documentation, unless otherwise specified,
SQL nomenclatures will be used.

## How This Works

### Mapping The Graph
In general an RDF Graph (and thus a SPARQL endpoint) is an instance of a navigational database, SQL is generally designed to work
against a relational model so there this application attempts to map a navigational database onto relational tables and keys.  It 
does this through the use of a "SchemaBuilder" implementation to map the RDF Graph to tables and columns.
The default implementation looks for RDF resources that have a rdf:type of rdfs:Class.  It consideres 
each of theose resources as tables and uses the resource name as the table name, we will call these "Table Resources".  It then scans the 
RDF store looking for distinct properties of objects of the "Table Resource" types.  The properties are the columns in the table.  All tables generated by the "SchemaBuilder" are 
stored in a SQL Schema, so multiple schemas may be created from a single RDF Schema, Vocabulary or datastore.

It is possible to override the default implementation by implementing a new SchemaBuilder and adding it to the /META-INF/services/org.xenei.jebc4sparql.sparql.builders.SchemaBuilder file.
The first entry in the file is considered the default builder.

### Generating A Query
A SQL query is parsed by a "SparqlParser" implementation the and converted into a SPARQL query.  
The default implementation of SparqlParser is LGPL v3 and uses an LGPL v2.1 based package.  Other implementations may be used.
To register a different implementation place it as the first entry in the /META-INF/services/org.xenei.jebc4sparql.sparql.parser.SparqlParser file.
The retured query is then excuted against the SPARQL endpoint or the 
Jena Model.  The SPARQL ResultSet is retrieved and the QuerySolutions stored in a local list.  A SQL ResultSet is 
created against that list and returned.
